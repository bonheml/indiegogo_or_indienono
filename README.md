To correctly run the notebook you have to:
- install requirements using  `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ensure you're running under python3.5 or later)
- download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/indiegogo-project-statistics/data and unzip it in
the folder named indiegogo_raw_data.
- Run the file named `improved_combiner.py` already present in the folder to combine all the csv files. A file named indiegogo_raw_dataset must appear at the root of the project folder.
- Run the notebook with the command `jupyter notebook`
